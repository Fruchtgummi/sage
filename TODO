FC is required (should not)

paths are suboptimal.
/build/pkgs should be /pkgs
/build/etc should be /dist/etc (done?)
/build/bin should be /dist/bin (done?)
/src should be pkgs/libsage or sagelib

dependencies should be where packages are, not in "deps"

PYTHON dependency, currently using SAGE_LOCAL/bin/python unconditionally
(do it like singular)

CORE_MODULES should be built with VPATH.

uninstall before fresh install

src must be <packagename>-<version> or src-<version>, hmmm #17495

remove this file

installation: can be implemented as follows:
- make DESTDIR work (e.g. through sage-dist-install)
- configure sage (the distribution) with a prefix, as usual
- build sage (will install with DESTDIR=@top_builddir@/.local
- @top_builddir@/local symlinks to .local/$prefix
- "make install" now just installs everything


other things:

In other words, it does not work to do:
          $(LN_S) foo /x/bar
Instead, do:
          (cd /x && $(LN_S) foo bar)
