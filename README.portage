Quick start
===========
You can use the following commands to install sage from this git repository:

    git submodule update --init
    make

if you're on linux-amd64. In theory, you have to make some changes for other platforms:

    git submodule update --init
    make bootstrap

and update the local/etc/portage/make.profile to be a symlink to the right profile
for your host. Then continue:

    make

and done!

Parallel building
=================
If you want to build several packages simultaneously, you will probably want to use

    make bootstrap
    local/bin/emerge --jobs <N> legacy-spkg/sage-full

instead.

Prerequisites
=============
You need at least the following things on your system for this to work:
 * bash
 * autotools
 * git

If you don't have autotools, you can checkout the portage-prefix-autotooled branch:

    git checkout portage-prefix-autotooled
    git submodule sync
    git submodule update --init
    make

Description of the bootstrapping process
========================================
The following packages each depend on the former:

 * system cc
 * python2.7, GNU coreutils, GNU findutils
 * portage prefix
 * mpir, mpfr, mpc
 * (gcc)
 * all the rest

The second bullet point is bootstrapped by the Makefile if they are not on the
system. This uses a very basic parser of the ebuilds.

If the system cc is not gcc, or if it is not at least version 4.6, then we want
to recompile all its dependencies with our own gcc after we have compiled it.
