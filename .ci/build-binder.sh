# This script gets called from CI to push a docker image for binder to Docker
# Hub and also to push corresponding binder configuration to the github
# repository $SAGE_BINDER_ENV_GITHUB.

# The following environment variables are required in your CI system:
# * DOCKER_IMAGE the public name of the sagemath image for which we should
#   build a binder image
# * HTTP_GIT_SAGE (used to build a link to the commit represented by this
#   binder image as $HTTP_GIT_SAGE/COMMIT_SHA )
# * SSH_GIT_BINDER (repository to push the autogenerated binder configuration
#   to, git@ URL)
# * HTTP_GIT_BINDER (repository to pull the autogenerated binder configuration
#   from, https:// URL)
# * SECRET_SSH_GIT_BINDER_KEY (an RSA private key with push access to GIT_BINDER)

# Warning: It is a bit scary to give CI push access to git. We try to make sure
# that your key does not leak into the logs, see ./protect-secrets.sh.
# However, please make sure that the key has only push access to GIT_BINDER and
# that you do nothing otherwise too important in that repository.
